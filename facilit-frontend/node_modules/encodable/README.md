This package provides standardized API for encodable components and adopts the grammar from `vega-lite` grammar and copy their logic for determining  smart defaults (e.g. choosing scale type based on data type, etc.)
In addition, it leverages `superset-ui` packages to use the number and time formatters as well as color scales.
